 <h2>Naleka Beckford</h2>
 <p>My name is Naleka Beckford, and I am a full-time second-year student at the University of the West Indies, Five Islands campus.
    I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Management. I chose to pursue a career in technology because of its versatility and integration with numerous other industries.
    Additionally, I decided to minor in Management to become a more well-rounded job candidate. 
    While I haven't yet decided on a specific area of the tech industry to focus on, I am particularly interested in Web Development and Artificial Intelligence due to the opportunities for innovation and creativity. 
    Considering how little experience I have in this field, I am eager to learn more in this course.
